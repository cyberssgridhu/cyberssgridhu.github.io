                  The advancement of sustainable energy sources necessitates the development of robust forecasting tools for efficient energy management. A prominent player in this domain, solar power, heavily relies on accurate energy yield predictions to optimize production, minimize costs, and maintain grid stability. This paper explores an innovative application of tiny machine learning to provide real-time, low-cost forecasting of solar energy yield on resource-constrained edge internet of things devices, such as micro-controllers, for improved residential and industrial energy management. To further contribute to the domain, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of four prominent machine learning models, namely unidirectional long short-term memory, bidirectional gated recurrent unit, bidirectional long short-term memory, and simple bidirectional recurrent neural network, for predicting solar farm energy yield. Our analysis delves into the impacts of tuning the machine learning model hyperparameters on the performance of these models, offering insights to improve prediction accuracy and stability. Additionally, we elaborate on the challenges and opportunities presented by the implementation of machine learning on low-cost energy management control systems, highlighting the benefits of reduced operational expenses and enhanced grid stability.

                  In recent years, the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and communication networks has presented significant challenges to power system control and protection, primarily as a result of the emergence of smart grids and cyber threats. As the use of grid-connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems continues to increase with the use of intelligent PV inverters, the susceptibility of these systems to cyber attacks and their potential impact on grid stability emerges as a critical concern based on the inverter control models. This study explores the cyber-threat consequences of selectively targeting the components of PV systems, with a special focus on the inverter and Overcurrent Protection Relay (OCR). This research also evaluates the interconnectedness between these two components under different cyber-attack scenarios. A three-phase radial Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) is employed for grid modeling and transient analysis under different cyber attacks. The findings of our analysis highlight the complex relationship between vulnerabilities in inverters and relays, emphasizing the consequential consequences of affecting one of the components on the other. In addition, this work aims to evaluate the impact of cyber attacks on the overall performance and stability of grid-connected PV systems. For example, in the attack on the PV inverters, the OCR failed to identify and eliminate the fault during a pulse signal attack with a short duration of 0.1 s. This resulted in considerable harmonic distortion and substantial power losses as a result of the protection system’s failure to recognize and respond to the irregular attack signal. Our study provides significant contributions to the understanding of cybersecurity in grid-connected solar PV systems. It highlights the importance of implementing improved protective measures and resilience techniques in response to the changing energy environment towards smart grids.

                  The existing literature on cyber-physical threat investigations predominantly concentrates on the high voltage (HV) level, disregarding the higher probability of cyber-attacks and threats targeting low voltage (LV) networks. In the context of smart grids, where millions of interconnected electronic devices span from power generation units to customer interface units through communication networks, the reliability of electrical infrastructure and information security face immediate challenges. This research aims to fill this gap by tracing the impact of various cyber-physical threat scenarios on a realistic LV power distribution network, utilizing simulations conducted with ETAP. Furthermore, this work will present a comprehensive risk assessment of the consequences of cyber-attacks on LV networks, encompassing distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The inclusion of DERs and smart components introduces security vulnerabilities through their remote control and communication capabilities. Although the impact of cyber-attacks on LV networks, typically leading to localized power outages, has received limited investigation, the potential for national consequences remains largely unexplored, especially when a cyber-attack targets a microgrid system. The findings will contribute to the improvement of smart grid systems, and response mechanisms against ongoing attacks.

                  Recently, smart grids introduce significant challenges to power system protection due to the high integration with distributed energy resources (DERs) and communication systems. To effectively manage the impact of DERs on power networks, researchers are actively formulating adaptive protection strategies, requiring robust communication schemes. However, concerns remain over the occurrence of communication connection failures and the potential risks presented by cyber-attacks. This work addresses these challenges by investigating the impact of cyber-attacks on different adaptive overcurrent relays (OCRs) approaches. Here, modern adaptive OCR coordination approaches using different group settings has integrated in evaluating high voltage/medium/low voltage (HV/MV/LV) network model with real network parameters at the MV/LV level. Additionally, a voltage-based relay is developed and employed to enhance protection system performance under various cyber threats, aiming to reduce tripping time and to minimize energy that is not supplied. The results show that voltage-based scheme outperform the traditional adaptive OCRs in terms of response time and mis coordination events under cyber-attacks. In the proposed MV/LV real network scenario characterized by an 89% availability of a 4 MW photovoltaic system, even a brief interruption caused by cyber-attacks can result in significant cost consequences.                  <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>

                  <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-left quote-icon-left"></i>
The rapid expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyber-physical threats, raising concerns about the resilience of both charging and smart power grid systems. This paper presents an innovative investigation into the resilience of EV charging infrastructure using a real-time co-simulation testbed, integrating both power network models and communication protocols such as IEC 61850. The study addresses gaps in existing research by implementing a realistic smart grid environment that incorporates EVs, charging stations and communication networks to simulate cyber-physical interactions. Key cyber-attacks, such as remote charging station status and configuration manipulations and their impact on it, are analysed in real-time simulations. Results show that even a relatively small attack utilising an IEEE 9-bus system with two EV charging stations can severely disrupt grid stability. The paper also explores various attacks targeting EV infrastructure, including charging stations, communication protocols, and management systems. The combined effects of cyber-attacks on power consumption and current variation highlight the critical importance of ensuring that charging infrastructure can adapt to sudden changes in demand while maintaining operational integrity.

The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into DC motor drives has prompted the enhancement of motor performance. This study explores the application of photovoltaic generators (PVs) to independently power and excite a Separately Excited Direct-Current (SEDC) system by utilizing a proportional open-circuit voltage method as a strategy for tracking the maximum power point. This approach offers an effective means of optimizing energy output from PV systems. The primary aim was to optimize power output from photovoltaic generators across varying solar intensity levels. This paper describes the nonlinear current/voltage behaviour of PV generators under different levels of irradiation, along with the magnetic characteristics of the core material in an SEDC motor, utilizing advanced polynomial equations for accurate mathematical representation. Furthermore, we conducted a dynamic analysis of the SEDC motor, powered by the PV generators, under varying solar intensities. This study investigates the operational performance of the SEDC motor under varying solar irradiance levels by developing a realistic model using MATLAB software, R2022a, for numerical simulations, followed by implementation on high-performance computing platforms, including a real-time simulator and testbed, using a real-time digital simulator (RTDS).

The global demand for electric vehicles is predicted to grow rapidly. However, charging Electric Vehicles (EVs) presents a challenge for Distribution Networks (DN) utilities. In a smart grid, effective communication between the charging stations, DN operator, and customers is crucial for arranging multiple charging sessions based on client preferences while following operational grid limits and costs. The modern and smart EV charging stations with interconnectivity requirements and online applications within the smart DN introduce potential risks of cyber-attacks and cause significant technical and financial consequences. Therefore, this study investigates the resilience of a smart distribution grid, specifically integrating EV charging stations and considering different cyber-physical threats. The impact of different cyber-attacks, namely: False Data Injection (FDI) and Man in The Middle (MITM), on low voltage microgrid models including the EV charging stations, are evaluated. The simulation uses a 24-hour load and generation profiles scenario and the results highlight the impact of cyber-physical threats on energy loss, transformer loading and voltage terms.
